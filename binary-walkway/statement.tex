\begin{problemDescription}

Alice has recently transferred to Case Western Reserve University and she was immediately told about our legendary Binary Walkway.

As a PhD Math candidate, Alice is super interested in this construction. Fortunately, Case Western Reserve University has funding to build another binary walkway and is looking for a design idea from the CWRU community. Alice would love to submit her design, but there is a problem: there are some previous designs from other students which are all rejected.

Therefore, in order to be eligible, her design needs to \textbf{be different from} those submitted designs. You are a super talented CS major and a close friend of hers. Please help Alice with an eligible idea!

\begin{inputDescription}

    The first line consists of an integer $n$ $(0 \leq n \leq 20)$.

    The next line consists of $n$ binary strings of exact length $n$ denoting the rejected designs of binary walkways.
    

\end{inputDescription}

\begin{outputDescription}
A binary string of exact length . This string should be different from any provided string.
